                    <h3>Workflow:</h3>
                    <p>To kick off the redesign, I first reviewed the existing app to identify where users might lose interest and how the overall vibe could better reflect musics energetic and social nature. I then mapped out a user persona to capture the type of people most likely to use this app—students, young adults, and music lovers looking for a fun, communal experience. From there, I sketched wireframes to rethink the navigation and interaction flow, while also experimenting with color palettes, typography, and micro-animations that could bring the interface to life. Once I finalized the design direction, I created high-fidelity mockups and added engaging motion elements to make the app feel vibrant, exciting, and fun to use.</p>

            <div class="intro-right">
                <p>YouCue is a music cueing app that lets users pick and queue songs at different locations. While the concept is fun, the existing design felt dated and lacked energy. The visuals were flat, and there wasnt much happening in terms of interaction or motion. This made the app feel less engaging and didnt match the lively, social vibe that music naturally brings. I set out to redesign the app with a fresh look, bringing in a more fun and hip atmosphere through playful animations, smoother interactions, and a more dynamic layout!</p>

            <div class="showcase-text">
                <p> While creating the final frames for the redesign, I ran into a few challenges that shaped the outcome of the app. One of the biggest decisions was settling on a color scheme that captured the fun and energetic vibe I wanted, while still feeling clean and easy to use. I experimented with several palettes and tested them with users to find the right balance.</p>

            <div class="showcase-text">
                <p>Another major focus was on the animations—I wanted them to be playful and engaging without becoming distracting. Striking that balance took several prototypes and refinements. I also spent time ensuring that key actions within the app (like adding a song to the queue) were always clear and accessible, while still keeping the overall flow visually fun and dynamic. After iterating through these design challenges, I landed on a version that feels both lively and functional, perfectly supporting the apps social and musical energy.</p>

            <div class="showcase-text">
                <p>I am really pleased with how the final redesign came together. The overall user flow of the app is smooth and easy to navigate, ensuring that users always know how to add songs, manage the queue, or interact with others without confusion. The playful animations and transitions make the experience more fun and engaging, while still keeping it intuitive.</p>

                <p>Features like the animated add-to-queue button and fluid screen transitions create a lively, welcoming vibe for users. On top of that, the updated color scheme and layout not only fit the energetic personality of the app but also help guide users through each step, making sure they stay engaged and never feel lost.</p>
